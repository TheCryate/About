<h1>Hi, I'm Batıhan!</h1>
  
I am working as a <strong>Software Test and Quality Assurance Specialist</strong> at Testinium. Before that, I was interested in developing Discord bots with JavaScript.
<p>As a former Computer Programmer, I will always have a soft spot for softwares. My desire for development and curiosity is where I thrive.</p>
